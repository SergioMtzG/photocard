## üß™ Roll GUI & System 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/07c4ae0c-cfb4-4cc3-8ad9-6791c23c4381)
### Overview:
- Roll, auto roll, fast roll interfaces
- ViewportFrames used to show 3D character previews
- Probability weights and luck effects

### Animation Script:
```lua
-- Animate roll
local function rollAnimation(groupName, finalNPC, rarity, isLuckBoost, spinFast)
    -- Make sure the same model doesn't show up twice in a row
    local previousModel = nil
    local num = 20

    -- This allows for fast spins
	if spinFast then
		num = 8
	end

    -- Each spin slows slightly to simulate momentum
	for i = 1, num do
		local randomModel
		repeat
			randomModel = getWeightedRandomNPCName(groupName, isLuckBoost) -- if luck boost it has better odds
		until randomModel ~= previousModel

		previousModel = randomModel
		local randomRarity = NPC_Rarities_ByGroup[groupName][randomModel].rarity

        -- Script that shows a model in a specific camera angle on the viewport object (on the screen)
		showModelInViewport(randomModel, randomRarity, groupName)
		spinAudio:Play()
		wait(0.04 + (i * 0.01))
	end 
end
```

This function is the heart of the game‚Äôs rolling system ‚Äî it controls the animation, pacing, and visual randomness that make the gacha experience feel dynamic and rewarding.

It utilizes the Roblox Viewport, a local screen object, to display character models that are stored in ServerStorage. These models are paired with rarity-specific colors, sound effects, and timed animations to give each roll its unique feel.

Additional logic includes:
- A **spinFast** variable, triggered by the fast-roll button, which reduces the spin to 8 models for a quicker animation.
- An **isLuckBoost** variable, activated either every 10th roll or via a luck boost item, which alters the underlying probabilities to favor rarer characters.

üåÄ Two-Stage Rolling Design:
Before spinning for an individual character, the system first spins through K-pop groups to land on one. Once selected, only members from that group are included in the character spin. This adds an extra layer of anticipation and gives each roll a more personalized, group-themed experience.

### Luck System Scripts:
```lua
local NPC_Rarities_ByGroup = {
	FEARLINGS = {
                -- Mythics 
		["Candy Wonnie"] = {weight = 5, rarity = "Mythic"},
		["Dress Sakkee"] = {weight = 5, rarity = "Mythic"},
		["Laker Jen"] = {weight = 5, rarity = "Mythic"},

		-- Legendaries (1% total = 100)
		-- characters here  

		-- Epics (7.5% total = 750)
		-- characters here  

		-- Rares
		-- characters here  

                -- Commons (50% total = 5000)
		["Wonnie"] = {weight = 1000, rarity = "Common"},
		["Jen"] = {weight = 1000, rarity = "Common"},
		["Zuaa"] = {weight = 1000, rarity = "Common"},
		["Sakkee"] = {weight = 1000, rarity = "Common"},
		["Munche"] = {weight = 1000, rarity = "Common"},
	},
        OTHER_GROUPS = {

        }
```

I designed the game with five rarity groups to balance excitement, collectibility, and player retention:

- The most decorated and iconic members or outfits are assigned to the highest rarities (e.g., Mythic, Legendary). These characters are rarer but more visually striking, with special effects‚Äîlike Candy Wonnie‚Äôs unique candy aura‚Äîand enhanced name tags in-game.

- The rarity tiers are weighted carefully to make rare characters feel special and valuable but still attainable enough to keep K-pop fans engaged and motivated to keep rolling.

- Common characters make up the majority of pulls to keep the collection accessible, while epic and rare tiers serve as exciting middle ground.

- This tiered system reflects the popularity and iconic status of members and their costumes, encouraging players who are fans of those groups to stay longer and enjoy hunting for their favorites.

```lua
-- Global variables:
local luckEffect = false

local function shouldApplyLuckBonus()
	if LuckEffectSystem.isLuckEffectActive() then
		luckEffect = true
	end
end


local function getWeightedRandomNPCName(groupName, isLuckBoost)
	-- Create a temporary table to hold boosted weights
	local tempWeights = {}
	for name, data in pairs(groupTable) do
		local effectiveWeight = data.weight

		-- If it's a luck boost roll, boost better rarities (reduce their effective weight)
		if isLuckBoost or luckEffect then
			print("LUCKYSPIN")
			if data.rarity == "Common" then
				effectiveWeight = data.weight * 0.4878
			elseif data.rarity == "Rare" then
				effectiveWeight = data.weight * 2.04
			elseif data.rarity == "Epic" then
				effectiveWeight = data.weight * 1.8
			elseif data.rarity == "Legendary" then
				effectiveWeight = data.weight * 2
			elseif data.rarity == "Mythic" then
				effectiveWeight = data.weight * 3
			end
		end
	end

	local rand = math.random(1, totalWeight)
	local counter = 0
	for name, weight in pairs(tempWeights) do
		counter += weight
		if rand <= counter then
			return name
		end
	end
end
```
Additionally, when choosing a random character for a roll, the system checks whether the roll qualifies as ‚Äúlucky.‚Äù This can happen in two ways:

- Guaranteed Luck Roll: Every 10th roll is automatically lucky, rewarding consistent play.

- Temporary Luck Boost: Picking up and activating a K-pop lightstick grants a 90-second window where luck is boosted.

If the roll is lucky, the game increases the chances of pulling rarer characters by dynamically adjusting probability weights during the selection process. This system creates rewarding peaks in gameplay while incentivizing both long-term play and map exploration.

## üíº Inventory System 

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/473f79bb-edfa-4fa5-8457-eb35a96e3efc" width="700"/>

### Overview:
- Inventory GUI creation
- DataStores to save player information
- Shared game state

### Inventory UI:

<p align="center">

</p>


``` lua
button.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()

	local inventoryData = getInventoryFunction:InvokeServer()

	-- Loop through the desired order
	for _, charName in ipairs(characterOrder) do
		if inventoryData[charName] then  -- Check if the player has this character
			local newButton = template:Clone()
			newButton.Name = charName
			newButton.Text = charName .. " x" .. inventoryData[charName]
			newButton.Parent = container
			newButton.Visible = true

			local countLabel = newButton:FindFirstChild("Count", true)  -- true = search descendants
			if countLabel and countLabel:FindFirstChild("CountLabel") then
				countLabel.CountLabel.Text = "x" .. inventoryData[charName]
			end

			local viewport = newButton:FindFirstChild("ViewportFrame")
			if viewport then
				local info = characterInfo[charName]
				if info then
					loadNPCInViewport(viewport, charName, info.group, info.rarity)
				end
			end

			newButton.MouseButton1Click:Connect(function()
				local info = characterInfo[charName]
					if info then
						selectedCharacter = { name = charName, rarity = info.rarity, group = info.group }
						print("Selected character: " .. charName)
						rarity.Text = info.rarity
						rarityName.Text = info.rarity
						modelName.Text = charName
						groupName.Text = info.group
						infoFrame.Visible = true
						loadNPCInViewport(choseViewport, charName, info.group, info.rarity)

						-- Update equip button text based on equipped status
						updateEquipButtonText()
					end
				end)
			end
		end
	end
end)

```

These scripts and objects power the games inventory system. An inventory UI template was created using various Roblox UI elements, including TextLabels, ViewportFrames, and ImageButtons, styled to match the roll animation UI for visual consistency. Each inventory slot uses a viewport to preview the character in 3D, just like during the roll. When the main inventory button is clicked, the script uses a RemoteFunction to retrieve that specific player‚Äôs saved inventory from Roblox's **DataStore API**. It loops through a predefined order of characters, clones and updates the template with that player‚Äôs owned units, and loads matching models and rarities into each viewport. Every slot is fully clickable‚Äîclicking a character shows more detailed info to the left panel, including rarity, name, and group affiliation.

### Data Storing:

``` lua

local DataStoreService = game:GetService("DataStoreService")
local Players = game:GetService("Players")
local ReplicatedStorage = game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage")

local characterStore = DataStoreService:GetDataStore("CharacterInventory")
local rollEvent = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("Remotes"):WaitForChild("RollCharacter")
local getInventoryFunction = ReplicatedStorage:WaitForChild("Remotes"):WaitForChild("GetInventory")

-- Rolls and updates inventory
local function addToInventory(player, characterName)
	local userId = tostring(player.UserId)
	local success, data = pcall(function()
		return characterStore:GetAsync(userId)
	end)

	if not success then
		warn("Failed to get inventory for", player.Name)
		data = {}
	end

	data = data or {}
	data[characterName] = (data[characterName] or 0) + 1

	local saveSuccess, err = pcall(function()
		characterStore:SetAsync(userId, data)
	end)

	if not saveSuccess then
		warn("Failed to save inventory for", player.Name, err)
	end
end

-- Handle roll requests
rollEvent.OnServerEvent:Connect(function(player, characterName)
	addToInventory(player, characterName)
end)

-- Handle inventory fetch
getInventoryFunction.OnServerInvoke = function(player)
	local userId = tostring(player.UserId)
	local success, data = pcall(function()
		return characterStore:GetAsync(userId)
	end)
	if success then
		return data or {}
	else
		warn("Inventory fetch failed:", data)
		return {}
	end
end

```

This script is the backbone of Photocard RNG's progression system, handling all persistent player data. Built on Roblox's **DataStoreService API**, it ensures that every character a player collects is securely saved to Roblox‚Äôs servers, allowing their progress to persist across sessions and devices.

Without this, players would lose their entire inventory upon leaving ‚Äî which would make a collection-based game fundamentally unplayable. This script bridges that critical gap by managing:

- Storage: It creates and updates a player-specific table using their unique UserId as a key.

- Event Listening: It listens to RollCharacter and GetInventory Remote events. These are triggered from local UI scripts (such as the roll animation or inventory menu), and must communicate via RemoteEvents/Functions since the actual data lives on the server.

- Data Schema: Player inventories are stored as Lua tables where the character name is the key and the value is the count of how many times that character has been rolled.

When a roll is completed, the script updates the player‚Äôs stored data with the new character. When the inventory is opened, it fetches that player‚Äôs data and sends it back to the client. All of this is wrapped in safe pcall() blocks to handle potential read/write errors gracefully.

This separation between client visuals and server logic is what enables both a responsive UI and reliable, permanent storage ‚Äî making the game feel snappy and secure.

### Shared game state:

``` lua
local SharedGameState = {}
-- Create a table to store state
SharedGameState.State = {
	IsRolling = false,
	IsInventoryOpen = false,
	IsStorageOpen = false
}

-- Function to update rolling state
function SharedGameState:SetRollingState(isRolling)
	self.State.IsRolling = isRolling
	self.StateChanged:Fire("IsRolling", isRolling)
end

-- Function to update inventory open state
function SharedGameState:SetInventoryOpen(isOpen)
	self.State.IsInventoryOpen = isOpen
	self.StateChanged:Fire("IsInventoryOpen", isOpen)
end

-- Function to check rolling state
function SharedGameState:IsRolling()
	return self.State.IsRolling
end

-- Function to check inventory open state
function SharedGameState:IsInventoryOpen()
	return self.State.IsInventoryOpen
end

return SharedGameState
```

A subtle but essential feature behind the game's UI responsiveness is the Shared Game State module, stored in ReplicatedStorage. This lightweight module tracks whether critical UI actions ‚Äî like rolling or opening the inventory ‚Äî are currently in progress.

Its purpose is to enforce mutual exclusivity between conflicting actions. For example, if a player is mid-spin during a roll animation, the game temporarily blocks the ability to open the inventory. Similarly, if the inventory is open, the roll button is locked until the player closes it. This helps:

- Preserve the immersive experience, preventing visual glitches or overlapping menus.

- Protect against state corruption, like double-triggered animations or mismatched character previews.

- Keep user flow clean and intentional ‚Äî one interaction at a time.

By referencing and toggling shared flags in this module (e.g., isRolling, isInventoryOpen), local scripts coordinate seamlessly to maintain the illusion of a polished, single-threaded UI ‚Äî even though multiple UIs and systems are running in parallel under the hood.



## üåü Inspirations
### Game Design:
- Inspired by games like *Genshin Impact*, *All Star Tower Defense*, and *Obby but Better*
- Gacha system inspired by mobile games and random loot mechanics

### Character & Map Design:
- Character models influenced by [real groups/characters like LE SSERAFIM, TWICE]
- Map themes based on [e.g., music stages, concert sets, cityscapes]
